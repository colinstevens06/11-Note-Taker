# 11-Note-Taker

This note taker allows the user to write and save notes, delete notes, and ultimately keep tasks organized.

## Technologies Used

-  Express
-  JSON
-  JQuery
-  JavaScript
-  API

## Using This Program

This program was written to be run on a local server on PORT:3000. By running 'node server.js' from your terminal, you will fire a server. You can then visit 'http://localhost:3000/index.html' to run the application.

## The Code

We were given starter code - HTML, CSS and an index.js file - and we were to write code for the server (using Express) and routes for the API and HTML. We also had to clean up the index.js file and add additional code there for the application to work successfully.
